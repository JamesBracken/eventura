# Eventura â€” Events Booking & Admin Portal

Eventura is a straightforward, user-friendly events hub for organising and booking activities.  
Users can sign up, sign in, explore upcoming events, and secure tickets in just a few steps.  

Admins have a dedicated interface to create, edit, and manage events, including the ability to add detailed venue information.  

The project is built with **Vite + TypeScript + SCSS/Bootstrap** on the frontend and **Spring Boot + MySQL** on the backend, ensuring a modern, scalable, and maintainable codebase.

2. User account is created with `POST /api/users`, linking to the address ID
3. The frontend stores the returned user ID for session management

### Sign In
1. User enters email, which is verified via `GET /api/users/by-email?email=...`
2. The returned user ID is stored for identifying bookings and permissions

### Browse & Book
1. Events are loaded with `GET /api/events`
2. User selects an event and books tickets with `POST /api/bookings`
3. Bookings are displayed using `GET /api/bookings/user/{userId}`
