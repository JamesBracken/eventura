This file is used as a guide for how to organise and navigate
the structure of SASS 7-1 Architecture

Great article on this -- https://medium.com/@diyorbekjuraev77/be-a-master-at-creating-the-7-1-sass-pattern-776fdfb5a3b1

The below folders should be contained within the styles folder
When naming files add an underscore prior to the filename to remove it from
scss compilation ex. _modal.scss

abstracts
- Variables, mixins, colors, functions
base
- Reset, typography, normalize
components
- Button, card, navbar, modal, etc.
layout  (In this instance a layout folder was not necessary as 
bootstrap is already taking care of this)
- Grid, header, footer, nav
pages ( As this is a 1 page project there is no need for a pages
folder )
- Page specific styles product, blog, login, signup
themes
- Theme files like dark.scss or light.scss
vendors
- 3rd party styles like bootstrap, jquery etc.
main.scss
